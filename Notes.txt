package.json is a configuration for npm, it keeps a track of approx version the package is installed, whereas package-lock.json will have the exact version. node_modules will contain the codes fetched from npm for the dependencies in our project.

We should not put node_modules in git however package.json & package-lock.json should be put in git.

Transitive dependencies means that one dependency will depend on another dependency and so on.

Webpack, parcel & vite these are all bundlers which bundles the files and minified that as well.

(^) caret will update minor update automatically & (~) tilde will update major updates automatically, and if we remove the caret or tilde then it will always have the same version.

We can ignite parcel app by writing: npx parcel index.html.

We use npm when we install any package and we use npx when we execute any package.

Parcel will dev build, run local server, HMR(Hot Module Replacement), File watching algorithm written in c++, caching providing faster builds, image optimization, bundling, compressing, code splitting, differential bundling to support older browsers, error handling, https, tree shaking to remove unused code & minification.

React is not the only reason why react applications are fast it is also because of bundlers such as parcel.

With the help of browserslist package we can set value specific to any country as well.
